# Description
Creating and maintaining a project aint easy. I found myself setting up multiple projects wit a similar structure until I made use of GitHub-Templates. Setting up a project should take no more than a few minutes max and come with all features a modern project needs. I used this template a lot privately until some friends asked me to publish it. So here it is free to use under the MIT-License.

If you like this project please star it and share it with others.

# Installation
Click on "Use Template" to create a repository based on this one.
The new repository will contain all files and therefor all workflows, templates and assets.

It is recommended to update the .gitignore based on your project you will use this for.

Dont forget to change the LICENSE.

Unfortunately GitHub does not yet offer the possibility to transfer labels automatically, so if you want to use the same ones then please transfer them manually from [here](https://github.com/Witteborn/GitHubBoilerplate/labels)
